## HTML | Javascript | CSS | PUG
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript are languages that make up modern web development. They all work together to create web applications. HTML provides the backbone and structure to the page. It outlines the headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. CSS brings the style to the webpage, it is used to define the layout, colors, fonts, and positioning of HTML elements. JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the web pages. It can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to change the content and apperance of the webpage. The combination of these three tools allows for web developers to create powerful modern web-applications.

Pug is a template engine for HTML. It plays a role in simplifying the process of generating HTML markup by using much more readable syntax. Pug templates provide a way to structure the layout of web pages more efficiently and maintainably. JavaScript can be used to interact with Pug templates. Pug complements HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by bettering the templating process and making it easier for developers to create and manage the structure of web pages in a clean and organized manner.

## Node.js
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows for the executecution of JavaScript outside the web browser. It was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and has become very popular. It has a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, allowing the ability to build extensive network applications. Node.js utilizes Google's V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same one that runs on Chrome.

Another big plus to Node.js is Node Package Manager (NPM). NPM allows for developers to access a wide range of libraries to extend the functionality of their applications. The combination of NPM and JavaScript has been one of the leading causes to Node.js' popularity. These tools can be used to creating web servers and real-time applications to building command-line tools and desktop applications.

## Express
Express.js, is a web application framework for Node.js. It was created to simplify the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a features and tools for web development. Developed by TJ Holowaychuk and released in 2010, Express has since become one of the most widely used web frameworks in the Node.js ecosystem.

Express simplifies the process of creating web applications by offering a straightforward structure. It provides a variety of built-in features for routing, handling HTTP processes, and working with middleware. This flexibility makes it easy to add custom logic, authentication, and other functionality to an application. Express also has an active community and a lot of plugins. Express is a good tool for building both small-scale applications and large.


## MongoDB
MongoDB is a popular and open-source NoSQL database. It was first developed by the company 10gen and was released in 2009. MongoDB is a document-oriented database, meaning it stores data in JSON-like documents. Unlike traditional relational databases such as SQL databases, MongoDB doesn't use tables, giving developers the freedom to work with unstructured or semi-structured data.

One of MongoDB's best features is its horizontal scalability, this allows the database to stor huge amounts of data while still being very fast. This makes it an excellent choice for applications with rapidly changing structures of data or projects that will keep getting larger and larger. MongoDB's query language and indexing capabilities are also very powerful. The database can also be connected to many different programming languages and environments, adding to its' capabilites and making it a popular choice for many developers.
