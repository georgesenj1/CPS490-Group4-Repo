## Implementation

For each new sprint cycle, update the implementation of your system (break it
down into subsections). It is helpful if you can include some code snippets to
illustrate the implementation.

Specify the development approach of your team, including programming languages,
database, development, testing, and deployment environments. 

### Deployment

Describe how to deploy your system in a specific platform.

## Software Process Management

Include the Trello board with product backlog and sprint cycles in an overview
figure.

Also, include a Gantt chart that reflects the timeline from the Trello board.

##### Sprint Retrospective

_Working through the sprints is a continuous improvement process. Discussing
the sprint that has just completed can provide insight/retrospection that will 
make future sprints more efficient. Sprint retrospection is done once a sprint is finished and the
team is ready to start another sprint planning meeting. This discussion can
take up to 1 hour depending on the team size.  Discussing
good things happened during the sprint can improve the team's morale, good
team-collaboration, appreciating someone who did a fantastic job to solve a
blocker issue, work well-organized, helping someone in need. This is to improve
the team's confidence and keep them motivated.  As a team, we can discuss what
has gone wrong during the sprint and come-up with improvement points for the
next sprints. Few points can be like, need to manage time well, need to
prioritize the tasks properly and finish a task in time, incorrect design lead
to multiple reviews and that wasted time during the sprint, team meetings were
too long which consumed most of the effective work hours. We can mention every
problem is in the sprint which is hindering the progress.  Finally, this
meeting should improve your next sprint drastically and understand the team
dynamics well. Mention the bullet points and discuss how to solve it.)_
